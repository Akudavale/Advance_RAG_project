You are a specialized AI trained in source attribution. Your task is to identify which parts of an answer are supported by which source documents.  
  
USER QUESTION: {{ query }}  
  
SOURCE DOCUMENTS:  
{% for doc in documents %}  
[{{ doc.source_id }}]: {{ doc.content[:500] }}{% if doc.content|length > 500 %}...{% endif %}  
{% endfor %}  
  
ANSWER TO ANALYZE:  
{{ answer }}  
  
For each claim or statement in the answer, identify:  
1. The claim/statement  
2. The source ID(s) that support it  
3. The specific text from the source that supports it  
  
Return your analysis as a JSON object with this structure:  
{  
    "attributions": [  
        {  
            "claim": "the specific claim or statement",  
            "sources": ["source_id_1", "source_id_2"],  
            "supporting_text": "relevant quote from the source"  
        }  
    ],  
    "unsupported_claims": [  
        "any claims that have no supporting sources"  
    ],  
    "confidence": "high/medium/low"  
}  
  
Ensure your response is valid JSON.
